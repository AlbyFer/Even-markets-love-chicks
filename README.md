Exploring relationships between gender equality and economic growth

The following paper describes a study conducted with exploratory multivariate
techniques on a Gender Equality and Economic dataset. Its main aim is to explore
potential relationships among the variables and extrapolate useful research questions.
From such analysis, it emerges that the main variables which really dierentiates
countries are not average income levels or GDP but gender equality in secondary
education and the level of infant mortality. This interesting view could be subsequently
researched using inferential methods. Secondly, a potential research hypothesis is
discussed that identifies those previous variables as drivers (and not consequences) of
good economic performance. Finally, some interesting relationships among variables
are discussed.
